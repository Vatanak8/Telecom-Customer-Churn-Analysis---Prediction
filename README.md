# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Analysis-&-Prediction

## Project Overview

This application is designed to help businesses predict customer churn, which refers to the likelihood of customers discontinuing their services or subscriptions. By identifying customers at risk of churn, businesses can implement targeted retention strategies to improve customer satisfaction and reduce revenue loss. Utilizing the Gradient Boosting model for prediction and an analytic customer dashboard on Power BI enables proactive customer retention and profitability enhancement in the telecom sector. Additionally, interactive visualizations are deployed through Streamlit to offer stakeholders actionable insights via a user-friendly web app interface.
